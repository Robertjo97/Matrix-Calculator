# Matrix Calculator Web Application

This is a simple web application that allows users to perform basic matrix operations and standard arithmetic calculations. It consists of two main components: a calculator for standard arithmetic operations and a matrix calculator for matrix-related operations.

## Features

### Standard Calculator

The standard calculator provides basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a user-friendly interface with large buttons for easy input.

### Matrix Calculator

The matrix calculator allows users to perform various matrix operations, including matrix addition, matrix subtraction, and matrix multiplication. Users can input the dimensions of two matrices, input values into matrix cells, and perform operations on the matrices. The application also provides options for matrix transpose and calculating the trace of a matrix.

## Usage

1. **Standard Calculator:**

   - Use the buttons to input numbers and perform standard arithmetic operations.
   - Press the "CE" button to clear the input.
   - Press the "SQRT" button to calculate the square root of a number.
   - The "=" button calculates the result of the expression entered.

2. **Matrix Calculator:**

   - Enter the dimensions (n x m) for both Matrix A and Matrix B.
   - Use the input fields to enter values into the matrix cells.
   - Press the "Calc" button to perform matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
   - The "Transpose" button allows you to transpose the matrix.
   - The "Trace" button calculates the trace of the matrix.
   - The "Go" button creates the matrices based on the provided dimensions.
   - The "Clear" button clears the matrices and allows you to enter new dimensions.

## About

This project was created for my Web Programming class at California State University, Fresno. Its main purpose is to demonstrate basic arithmetic and matrix operations using a web application. It serves as a useful tool for users who need to perform mathematical calculations quickly and conveniently.
